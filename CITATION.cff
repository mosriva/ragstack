abstract: >
  RAGStack is a fully local, privacy-first Retrieval-Augmented
  Generation (RAG) framework for enterprise document intelligence and question answering. It integrates
  PyMuPDF for parsing, SentenceTransformers for embedding generation, FAISS for local
  semantic retrieval, and Ollama-hosted large language models (LLMs) for response
  generation. Featuring auto-indexing, manifest-based deduplication, self-healing
  index rebuilding, and normalized (0–1) similarity scoring, the framework enables
  compliance-ready AI deployment in offline or air-gapped enterprise environments.
